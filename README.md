## Some questions I'd like to answer using our dataset "Most streamed songs on Spotify 2023"

- Top 10 artists with most songs streamed?<br>
- Top 10 most streamed songs<br>
- How does an artist's total number of songs correlate to the total number of streams?
- Distribution of songs based its characteristics? (Danceability, Valence, Energy, Acousticness, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Speechiness)<br>
    - How do these correlate to the song's popularity?
- What is the distribution on the song's tempo (BPM)?<br>
    - How does the song tempo compare to the number of streams?<br>
- What's the distribution of the song's key for this list?<br>  
- Which ones are in Major or in Minor? (Major are mostly associated as a "happy" song as opposed to Minor being "sad")<br>
- How does it compare to its number of streams or which one is more popular? How does it compare to Valence% or Danceability% or Energy%?<br>
