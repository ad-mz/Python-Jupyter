# Hi this is me just practicing my data analysis using Python

Some questions I'd like to answer using our dataset "Most streamed songs on Spotify 2023"
1) Artists with most songs streamed?  
2) Oldest song in the most streamed songs in 2023? (by release date)  
3) Most streamed songs with the most artist in the song
4) Which songs are added in most playlists?
5) Top 10 most streamed songs
