# Hi this is me just practicing my data analysis using Python

Some questions I'd like to answer using our dataset "Most streamed songs on Spotify 2023"
1) Artists with most songs streamed?  
2) Oldest song in the most streamed songs in 2023? (by release date)  
3) Most streamed songs with the most number of artists in a song
4) Which songs are added in most playlists?
5) Top 10 most streamed songs
6) What is the fastest song? The slowest? (BPM)
7) How does the BPM compare to the number of streams?
8) Among the top 50 songs, which key of the song is commonly used?  
9) Which ones are in Major or in Minor? (Major are mostly associated as a "happy" song as opposed to Minor being "sad")  
10) How does it compare to its number of streams or which one is more popular? How does it compare to Valence% or Danceability% or Energy%?
11)
