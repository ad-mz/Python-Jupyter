# I'm just practicing my data analysis using Python

## Some questions I'd like to answer using our dataset "Most streamed songs on Spotify 2023"

1. Top 10 artists with most songs streamed?<br>
2. Oldest song in the most streamed songs in 2023? (by release date)<br> 
3. Most streamed songs with the most number of artists in a song<br>
4. Which songs are added in most playlists?<br>
5. Top 10 most streamed songs<br>
6. What is the fastest song? The slowest? (BPM)<br>
7. How does the BPM compare to the number of streams?<br>
8. Among the top 50 songs, which key of the song is commonly used?<br>  
9. Which ones are in Major or in Minor? (Major are mostly associated as a "happy" song as opposed to Minor being "sad")<br>
10. How does it compare to its number of streams or which one is more popular? How does it compare to Valence% or Danceability% or Energy%?<br>
